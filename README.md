# azure-configs
This is a mod of azure-configs RPM for Clear Linux. It fixes the typo in the service files of the Hyper-V daemons (they're all named fcopy daemon) and also adds the KVP helper scripts. Nothing ground breaking--no one probably noticed but just one of those "I couldn't unsee once I saw" type of this.

Not a pro at Clear Linux mixology but this build works and it fixes what I wanted it to. Just thought I'd share incase someone else randomly loves PowerShell and Clear Linux like I do.
