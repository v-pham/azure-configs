# azure-configs
This is a mod of azure-configs RPM for Clear Linux. It fixes the typo in the service files of the Hyper-V daemons (they're all named fcopy daemon) and also adds the KVP helper scripts. Nothing ground breaking--no one probably noticed but just one of those "you can't unsee once you see." Not a pro at Clear Linux mixology but this build works.
